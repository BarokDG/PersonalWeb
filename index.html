        <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Past and ongoing Work</h3>
        <ul class="pl-3">
            <li>
                I interned at Bluemoon Ethiopia working on the gebeya.net platform back in the summer of 2017. It was a
                project that aimed to modernize the transaction between local farmers in rural areas and customers in
                other
                cities all over Ethiopia.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm currently working as part of a media team, mainly overlooking video edits, propresenter
                presentations and content creation, at Thrive. Thrive is a Young Adults ministry that focuses on helping
                the youth grow spiritually. I've had this position for little more than a year and I've learnt a lot
                during the process.
        </ul>
        <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Volunteering</h3>
        <p>
            I like working in teams and helping people, so I've tried to participate in a couple of volunteering
            programs.
            <ul class="pl-3">
                <li>
                    <strong>YWCA (Young Women's and Children's Association)</strong>
                    I volunteered there after I finished 10th grade (2016). I had a lot of fun and managed to help a lot
                    of
                    kids in elementary school, better understand their subjects. Math and English mainly. I also made a
                    lot
                    of friends and matured a lot, along the way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Red Cross</strong> I managed to volunteer here for a couple of weeks in 2016. I helped
                    organize
                    a lot of papers and also called previous blood donors to remind them to come and donate blood again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Youth for Christ</strong> I volunteered at this organization last year (2019). It's an
                    organization that imports books fron donors outside Ethiopia and tries to set up libraries all over
                    the
                    country. It also organizes fun and educating summer programs for elementary and high school kids.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
