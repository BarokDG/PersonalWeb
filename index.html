    <h3>Past and ongoing Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I interned at Bluemoon Ethiopia working on the gebeya.net platform back in the summer of
            2017. It was a project that aimed to modernize the transaction between local farmers in
            rural areas and customers in other cities all over Ethiopia.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm currently working as part of a media team, mainly overlooking video edits and
            content creation, at Thrive. Thrive is a Young Adults ministry that focuses on helping
            the youth grow spiritually. It's a very recent position which I hope to get a lot of
            video editing and leadership experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm currently a member of the media team at Thrive which is an event every Sunday afternoon organized to
            create a platform for teens and youth to meet, connect, and strengthen their spiritual lives. I mostly
            handle presentations and create content for social media posts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
    <p>
        I like working in teams and helping people, so I've tried to participate in a couple of
        volunteering programs.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>YWCA (Young Women's and Children's Association)</strong>
                I volunteered there after I finished 10th grade (2016). I had a lot of fun and
                managed to help a lot of kids, in elementary school, better understand their
                subjects. Math and English mainly. I also made a lot of friends and matured a lot
                along the way.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Red Cross</strong> I managed to volunteer here for a couple of weeks in
                2016. I helped organize a lot of papers and also called previous blood donors to
                remind them to come and donate blood again.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Youth for Christ</strong> I volunteered at this organization in 2019. It's an organization that
                imports books fron donors outside Ethiopia and tries to set up libraries all over the country. It also
                organizes fun and educating summer programs for elementary and high school kids.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What does my future hold?</h3>

            e-commerce business. Plan to start working on it in summer 2020.
        </li>
        <li>

            ambitions.
