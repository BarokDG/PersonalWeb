        <p class="text-justify">
            This lesson is structured to teach students the mechanical and analytical skills necessary to be able to
            make consistent and appropriate marks on a page or canvas. It highlights the fact that trying to involve our
            brain too much during the act of making marks decreases the quality of the mark as our brain constantly
            tries to course-correct. Instead, it suggests that we let go of the desire for accuracy and prioritise flow,
            in the beginning stages, as accuracy is something that will come over time. Furthermore, this lesson
            stresses the fact that the ultimate goal of the exercises in this section is to offload the technical
            aspects of drawing to muscle memory and that students shouldn't get stuck trying to perfect each homework.
            The latter parts of the lesson focus on teaching the student some basic perspective concepts.

                                pivot to use in different situations. The main takeaway is to make sure my marks are
                                flowing smoothly and continuously while maintaining a consistent trajectory.</p>

                                particularly difficult to guide the stroke as you go.

                                you draw. To consider what purpose the mark you're about to make serves and whether or
                                not it is the best mark for that purpose, or if another existing one is already
                                accomplishing the same task.

                                Ellipses are extremely important and notoriously annoying to draw. They are found all
                                over the place in mechanical drawings. Cars, space ships, tanks, machines - anything
                                man-made will probably make extensive use of ellipses. This lesson builds on the
                                principle of making smooth and continuous marks, and applies it to ellipses. It also
                                describes the properties of ellipses as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Scale</strong> - the overall size of the ellipse</li>
                                    <li><strong>Orientation</strong> - the angle at which it is positioned</li>
                                    <li><strong>Degree</strong> - effectively the width of the narrower dimension of the
                                        ellipse</li>
                                </ul>

                                an ellipse was successful, or if there were visible mistakes (where it went outside of
                                its allotted space, or ended up falling short).

                                fact that your parallel lines converge. Due to the nature of perspective, with the
                                innumerable vanishing points that may be necessary in a given scene, we can't
                                necessarily rely on all of them being explicitly drawn out. Even though you've got

                                <strong>Purpose: </strong> The rotated boxes exercise is also about learning to infer
                                information about space and the arrangement of objects from neighbouring objects. Each
                                box has others beside, above and below it, and by the time you're drawing one, some of
                                these others have already been constructed. While their edges don't run perfectly
                                parallel to one another, they do have a similar enough trajectory to some of the next
                                box's edges to provide some important information.

                                <strong>Purpose: </strong> By diving into this exercise, you're being forced to contend
                                with freely rotating boxes in 3D space without any real grounding of how to deal with
                                them. There's no concrete vanishing points that you're marking out on the page, no
                                neighbouring forms to base things off. It's more guesswork than you'll have dealt with
                                till now. The point isn't to be able to nail this, but to get your gears turning as you
                                start thinking about the fact that this is a kind of spatial problem you're facing.
