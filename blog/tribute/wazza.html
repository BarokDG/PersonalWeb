                On Jan 15, 2021, Wayne Rooney aka Wazza, one of English football’s greatest icons, announced his
                retirement to pursue his managerial career at Derby County. Over his 15+ years of being a professional
                footballer, he won everything that can be won at club level, scored goal after goal, provided assists
                left and right, led by example, and consistently gave his all on the field. His passion, determination,
                and professionalism have earned him a place in every Manchester United fan's heart, especially in mine.
            </p>

            <p class="triP">
                I became a Manchester United fan even before I loved football. I suspect that's largely because my dad
                supported Man United and I did the same, probably seeking attention. But over time, as I spent more and
                more time watching games and getting to know the players, I developed a love for the game that manifests
                itself daily to this day. One of the players I got to know during that time was Wayne Rooney. When I try
                to think about my first memory of Rooney it’s of him getting a red card in the 2006 World Cup against
                Portugal, and my dad loudly stating that because of Ronaldo’s influence in the red card decision, Rooney
                and he would have a fallout back at United. That, of course, didn’t happen and they had a great season
                in which they won the league and combined for many goals.
            </p>

            <p class="triP">
                Over the next several seasons, Rooney continued to consistently put in performances that helped United
                win the Premier League title multiple times, the Champions League once, and several other trophies along
                the way. It was also during that time that he started balding, which was a popular topic since he was
                still very young. As I was a boy at the time and didn't have the means, like nowadays, to quickly google
                his age, I thought my favourite player was in his late thirties and was in the final years of his
                career. Thankfully, in reality, he was still young and had a lot of years ahead of him, and so did the
                hairs on his head, which made an astonishing comeback. Anyway, in 2009 Cristiano Ronaldo went to Real
                Madrid for a then-record transfer fee of 80 million pounds. Up until then, Rooney's main position was
                more or less a left-winger, as Ronaldo made his transition to centre-forward after the departure of,
                another legendary player, Ruud Van Nistlerooy. It was during this period that Rooney took the helm at
                the front and carried the team for a couple of seasons. He scored incredible goals, worked tirelessly
                for the team and always did it with a smile on his face. Choosing my favourite Rooney goal is always a
                difficult thing to do because of his extensive repertoire of golazos. But at the end of the day, I have
                to go with the bicycle kick winner against Manchester City at Old Trafford in 2011.
            </p>

            <p class="triP">
                As the years went on, Alex Ferguson, probably the most successful manager ever, was forced to retire and
                Rooney led the team into the post-Fergie era. Although his last few years weren't as successful, he
                continued to give his all on the pitch and help the team in new ways. In 2017, his 12-year stay at
                Manchester United came to an end, as he struggled to get game time. He moved to his boyhood club Everton
                and spent 1 good season before making the move to the MLS. At D.C. United in the MLS, Rooney once again
                proved his quality, determination, and leadership. He played relentlessly and scored more golazos.
            </p>
            <p class="triP">
                Fast forward to the start of 2020, Derby county managed to sign him to the club with the promise that in
                a year, he'd be the head coach of the team. At the age of 34, Wayne Rooney joined Derby County in the
                second-top flight League of English football, where he was able to maintain his passion and
                determination, which has always been his trademark trait. After a year at Derby, Rooney announced his
                retirement from his illustrious football career to make the quick transition into management.
            </p>
            <p class="triP">
                It is truly sad to see such a player of iconic stature hang his boots, even though, great players coming
                to the end of their career, is part of the game. I will forever miss watching Rooney play, but I will be
                comforted by all the happy memories I have of him.
